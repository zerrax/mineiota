Live on: [https://mineiota.com](https://mineiota.com/)

##  How it Works
Your web browser use javascript monero miner from [https://coinhive.com](https://coinhive.com/).

Coinhive provide how much XMR for 1 000 000 hashes they pay. Than we take actual price BTC/XMR and BTC/IOTA is given actual ratio how much iota per 1 calculated hash of monero.

Your balance of monero hashes is save in coinhive database. So you cannot lose your reward. You can always request again. But if you make duplicity requests it is deleted from queue. Only one can be in queue.

Price is fixed in USD, so your reward can changing value of iota in time, until you make withdrawal request and get first in line.

### How make withdrawal
* Minimal payout is 1 iota. Please be sure you know price on exchanges is in MIOTA. It is 1 000 000 iota. So you can get reward in the smallest part of iota.
* In log you can see how you receiving rewards in iota valuated to usd price.
* Anytime you can click on update to get total iota in acutal prices ratio.
* If you ready get your reward, click on Withdraw. Now you will be added to queue. Now you can wait on your reward or continue to mining. When you come in line, you will receive all actual reward in this time.
* If for some reason you see your transaction is still panding after one day. Is possible, here is some error in iota tangle and transaction was skipped. In this case your reward is still on mineiota.com just
take your address, do login again and make new withdraw request.
